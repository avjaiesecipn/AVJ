		This project is based on a similar one that has been carried out by <a href="http://www.aiesec.in" target="_blank" title=		
        "AIESEC">AIESEC India</a> 
            (Balakalakaar), We have obtained very good results since many of these children that had the opportunity to be part of 	
            the project, had been successful in causing social and professional development as a result of the fact that several
            of them reached important positions in different companies. We, the volunteers have the right skills to work with 	
            children, some of these skills are:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
                 <li>Give a positive impact on children</li>
                 <li>Strengthening values ​​and manners of children</li>
                 <li>Educate children about their future</li>
                 <li>Develop their skills in various fields</li>
                 <li>Improve future generations of our society</li>
                 <li>Contribute to their social and academic training</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>It is important to know how we should interact with children so that they do not feel attacked or discriminated 
        ,we also should know about what they like and interest about ,so we have the support from psychologists, organizations 
        and groups knowledgeable.
